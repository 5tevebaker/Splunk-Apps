### üë©‚Äçüíª Developer documentation

#### Test changes in your branch

Requires docker and docker-compose

```shell
cd test/standalone-with-data
docker-compose up -d --build
```

This takes several minutes the first time you run it. After a while, point your
browser to http://localhost:8001 for a Splunk server with sample logs you can
use to test the changes in your branch. After the Splunk server comes up, it
could take several more minutes for logs to show up on the server.

To save time in future tests, use `docker-compose stop` and
`docker-compose start` to turn the server off and on between testing
sessions. To completely reset the test environment type
`docker-compose down -v && docker-compose up -d --build`.

Note: Any change you make to the App or Add-on will show up immediately in
Splunk. There is a second docker container that monitors the App/Add-on
directories and reloads them in Splunk when a change is detected.

#### Publish a new release

Requires node and semantic-release npm package

```shell
# Test the release process on develop
semantic-release --dry-run --no-ci --branches=develop

# Verify in the output that the next version is set correctly
# and the release note is generated correctly

# Merge develop to master and push
git checkout master
git merge develop
git push origin master

# At this point, GitHub Actions is testing the release
# then building it for publication

# There is a manual step here. You'll have to get the build
# from the GitHub Actions artifacts and publish it on SplunkBase
# manually. We can automate this when the SplunkBase API is more mature.

# Now, sync your local with the remote to pull the new
# commits made by the release bot.
git pull origin master
git checkout develop
git merge master
git push origin develop
```
