Upgrade to App Version 4.1
--------------------------

This applies if upgrading from a pre-4.1 version of this app to 4.1 or
higher.

Starting in version 4.1 of this app, all of the dashboards use the Splunk 6
Datamodel feature, which allows for pivot of Palo Alto Networks data and
better control and acceleration of summary indexes used by the dashboards.
This replaces the TSIDX feature from Splunk 5.

After upgrade to 4.1 or higher, you may delete the TSIDX files that were
generated by the previous version of the app.  To delete the TSIDX files,
look under `$SPLUNK_HOME$/var/lib/splunk/tsidxstats/` and remove any
directories that start with `pan_`.  There could be up to 10 directories.

Splunk will backfill the datamodel with historic data up to 1 year old.  It
may take some time for historic data to show up in the dashboards, but it
will be available in the pivot interface and search immediately.  The time
range for historic data to be available in the dashboards can be adjusted
in the datamodel accelerations settings.

If you have customized the built-in dashboards of a previous app version,
then they will no longer work because the customized dashboards will still
use TSIDX.  Remove your custom dashboards from the `local` directory of the
app to use the new datamodel-based dashboards.  You can add your
customizations to the new dashboards.
